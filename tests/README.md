# tests/

Test harness and correctness gate. Lives **outside** `smt/` and consumes the
SMT-LIB2 dumps the printer produces (DESIGN.md §3, §8). Test code is exempt from
the `smt/` stdlib-only firewall (I3) but stays lean.

**Gate paths here are master-only** (AGENTS.md): child agents may not edit the
oracle, the Lean encoder, or the corpora, and may not change tests in the same
change as solver code. A test believed wrong becomes an issue for master
adjudication.

## Layout

- `harness/` — the `.smt2` runner. Loads each case, drives the session API, and
  emits a committed golden block per goal: verdict, core size, canonicalized
  model if sat, and log-scale bucketed counters (`<10`, `<100`, `<1k`
  conflicts/decisions/propagations). No wall-clock in goldens (I5). Accepted via
  the promote workflow (`make promote`). Also generates `STATUS.md`.
- `gate/` — the Lean 4 encoder + certification driver + content-addressed cache.
  Unsat queries become Lean theorems discharged `by grind`; sat models become
  ground goals closed by `decide`/`native_decide`. Cache maps canonical query
  hash → verdict + oracle outcome, keyed also by encoding version, Lean
  toolchain, and grind config. Cache lives in `../cache` (never in git).
- `cases/` — `*.smt2` regression cases: assertions + expected verdict, the same
  shape as the public benchmarks. Larger fetched corpora live in `../corpora`
  (never in git).

Status: skeleton — runner, gate, and cases arrive with M0-harness / M0-gate.
